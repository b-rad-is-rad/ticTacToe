Thoughts on how to implement

- 3 X's or O's in a row wins the Game
    - Check on each turn starting on Player 1's 3rd turn
    - How to Check for 3 in a row
            - From position, check if diagonal is possible
                - X and Y are both 1 or 3
                - X and Y are 2
            - Check each directional for 3 in a row
                - Loop valid directionals (h, v, 1d, 2d)
                    - Horizontal (always)
                        - 1,y 2,y 3,y
                    - Vertical (always)
                        - x,1 x,2 x,3
                    - Diagonal (5 spaces)
                        - Find diagonal direction. Figure out how to get to 2 for each coord then continue on that path.
                        - Ex: 3,1 ... to get each coord to 2,2 we must do -1,+1
                        - If 2,2 we do 2 diagonal checks
                            - top left to bottom right
                            - bottom left to top right
                - Stop check on opposing marker or empty space
                - No need to check space that player chose

- 3x3 board (9 spaces)
    - X/Y Coordinates
    - Each cell is an instance of class Cell
        - Cell
            - Location {obj}
                - x
                - y
            - Player Assignment {str}
                - x or o
- Each space can only be used once
    - Activate/deactivate cell after clicked. Add X or O to cell instance and disable cell via CSS.
- Clicking in a space assigns the space and starts next turn
    - onClick call togglePlayer()
- Randomly assign if X or O goes first for first game
    - Math.rand 0 or 1
- Winning the game disables the game and allows for reset
    - endGame(player) - ends game with the passed player as the winner
- When a tie has occurred, disables the game and allows for reset
    - endGame() - ends game in a tie
- Reset game button available at all times and highlighted at game end
- X and O alternate turns on reset
    - Toggle current player
